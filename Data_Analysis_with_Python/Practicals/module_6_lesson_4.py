# Step 2: Prepare Your Time Series Data
# Create a pandas DataFrame with time series data
# Each column represents a different time series
# Each row represents a timestamp
# Replace 'your_time_series_data.csv' with the path to your dataset
df = pd.read_csv('your_time_series_data.csv')

# Step 3: Extract Features
# Extract features from the time series data using Tsfresh
# Set the column 'id' to uniquely identify each time series
extracted_features = extract_features(df, column_id='id')

# Step 4: Preprocess Features
# Handle missing values in the extracted features
impute(extracted_features)

# Step 5: Apply Machine Learning Models
# Split the data into training and testing sets
X = extracted_features  # Features
y = df['target']         # Target variable
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
